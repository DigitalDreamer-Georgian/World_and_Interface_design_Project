Narration: Everyone’s heard the rumors. A shadow stalking the halls after sunset with red eyes and tentacles coming from its back. A ghost? A monster? No one knows. But  we’re going to find out.

Narration: Alex stands outside the school gates, holding his flashlight tightly.

Alex (Internal Thought): This is insane. But if the stories are true… someone has to stop it.

Narration: Alex steps inside the school. The metal doors creaking as they slowly open. The halls are dark, lit only by the dying sunset through the windows.


Riley: looks like you actually showed up. Thought you'd chicken out.

Devon: (Nervously) I think  we should’ve waited. It’s dangerous in here at night.

-> Alex: I’m not scared. Just cautious.

-> Alex: Maybe we should’ve. But we’re already here.

Riley: (Grinning) Now that’s the spirit! Come on, let’s stick together and keep the lights on.
Devon: (Muttering) Lights won’t help if it’s already watching us.

Narration: The trio moves deeper into the halls, their footsteps echoing. Lockers stand like silent sentinels.

Devon: So who do we talk to first?

Riley: I heard Jamie in the art room saw something. Said it whispered her name.

-> Alex: Let’s start there. Maybe she’ll talk.
    <<jump talktojamie>>
-> Alex: Maybe someone in the science wing knows more.

Narration: They head to the art room. Jamie is sketching quietly, headphones on. The room smells of paint and ink.

Riley: Jamie?
Jamie: (Pulling headphones off) Oh. You’re not here for class…

-> Alex: We heard you saw something.
    <<jump jamieRumor>>
-> Alex: This is about the... thing. The shadow.

Jamie: (Visibly shaken) I didn’t imagine it. I was here late. The lights flickered, and it stood there  it was black, tall, with with red eyes. Tentacles on its back.

Devon: (Scared)Just like the stories…

Jamie: It didn’t move at first just stared at me. Then it whispered my name. I ran.

Riley: Great. That’s comforting.

Alex: Thanks, Jamie. We’ll be careful.

Narration: In the science lab, a student named Chris adjusts a microscope.

Chris: You looking for the ghost thing too?

Alex: Heard you had your own run-in.

Chris: Not me. But I found something. Black slime. Like oil. Near the boiler room.

Devon: Gross.

Riley: Creepy. Let’s go check that out later.

Narration: As the group regathers in the hallway, the lights suddenly flicker.

Devon: Oh no. Not now.

Narration: A distant, low whisper echoes.

Voice (Distorted): Aaaaalex...


Riley: RUN!

Narration: They sprint toward the exit as shadows twist unnaturally down the hall...

Narration: The night isn't over. The whispers still follow. But now they know it’s real.

Narration: Tomorrow, they return. This time, to end it.
